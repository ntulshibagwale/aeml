So the flexural tests deflected the plate slightly,
so I'm going to perform the same test ~100 PLB
but now doing it on the side of the plate. 
Not sure how consistent this will be, but I wil
initially come in at a an angle. Should create both
extensional and flexural modes.

side -> broken on side of plate (very thin area)
Note this test was conducted on the same day at 03,
but different day than 01.
