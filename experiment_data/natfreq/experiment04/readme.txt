Kiran collected this data on two separate days.
The data collected on the first day was moved to its
own folder, decided not to analyze that data.

Pencil was oriented in the same way as experiment 03,
which Nick originally performed, where the pencil lead 
was broken on the side of the plate an angle.

This was done on the small thin 8" x 2" x 0.04" aluminum plate
with the machinist clamps, that was used for the PLB 
benchmarking dataset.

The point of this experiment was to see if we
could replicate the results from experiment 03,
in other words: does the signal change with 
changing boundary conditions? It should because
the reflections should increase.
