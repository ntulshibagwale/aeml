Kiran ran this experiment to investigate
how changing the distance affecting the AE 
signal from a fixed source.

Two sensors were positioned in the center of 
the plate. The pencil was broken at different 
distances from the midline. The pencil was broken
on the top edge.

8 in would correspond to the furthest away from
the sensors and 2 in would correspond to the closest.

The boundaries of the plate were not changed, the
sensors were not changed (B1025). 2 channels.

This experiment was done on the 2"x8"x0.04" aluminum plate.
