I want to investigate whether its possible to damp out some reflections.

Experimental was not the most repeatable, just used some neoprene lab gloves,
and rubber bands and squeezed them in between the machinist clamps to see 
if there is a distinct difference between those waves and the ones without
the material.

In between tests, it was challenging to keep the pencil lead break at the 
same location along the pencil lead itself because the height of the plate
would shift up and down. I did need to adjust the pencil up and down slightly
which may have impacted results.

I don't believe sensor was moved but the plate location wrt pencil would
roughly be the same, there was more variation there.

A better clamping method is needed in order to secure all the damp material
to the boundary. Will need to do this once we go up to a bigger plate.

Also note at this stage, from experiment 03 - 04 - 05, to the best of my
knowledge the fixture for holding the pencil at the top edge was not changed.
However for this experiment it was slightly changed. I did take photos.
However there is probably some variation there, 10-15 degrees possibly. Which
I would not expect to be a large factor.

Update: Data did not seem elucidating, won't consider further
