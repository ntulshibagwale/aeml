Kiran ran this experiment using the new 6ft aluminum plate.
The aluminum plate was oriented on its side to prevent deflection
due to plate weight. The pencil was broken "on top" of the plate
(not the thin edge). The pencil was broken adjacent to 4 sensors,
the idea being to observe how the wave changes as it propagates from sensor
to sensor. 
The boundary conditions were changed, hence the 6,12,18,24 in, which is 
an indication of where the plate was clamped.

It was observed that increasing the location increased the presence
of "double" events. Likely due to the larger deflections experiences by
the plate and the sensor will be deflected larger amounts on the wobbly
plate surface after a pencil lead break.

This data will be used to understand how the boundary conditions may 
impact the flexural portion of the wave. The speed of flexural waves
are frequency dependent. By changing the boundary conditions, we should
in theory be changing the frequency of the flexural waves, which would
slow down the waves (as the boundaries are moved further apart). Need
to analyze data to see whether this holds true.
