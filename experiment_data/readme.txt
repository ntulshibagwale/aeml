natfreq contains initial experiments exploring wave propagation in thin aluminum plates

robustness contains experiments generated waves for investigating robustness of 
ML frameworks for source identification. Again, using thin aluminum plate.

create_filtered_dataset is used for the creation of .json files which contain
filtered waveforms from a given experiment.
