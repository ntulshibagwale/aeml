Conducted on the same day as 03.
The boundaries of the plate were shifted from 6 in to 8 in, meaning
each clamp was 8 inches away from the center of the plate. The 
sensors were not moved.

Three different types of location / source orientations

1.5 dist corresponds to 1.5 in from middle of the plate.
