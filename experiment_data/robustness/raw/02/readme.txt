Update: 7-7-2022

Experiment conducted on 7-7-2022 between Nick and Kiran.

Kiran conducted the first 6 experiments at dist = 0,
which corresponds to the midpoint of the aluminum plate,
and Nick conducted 6 experiments at dist = 1.5. which is 1.5in to the left.

Channel 1 corresponds to the leftmost B1025 (facing from where the pencil is)
Channel 2 is left S9225
Channel 3 is right B1025
Channel 4 is right S9225

The sensors (B1025 and S9225) were not shifted during this experiment.

50 waves per placement.

backcorner corresponds to pulling the lead into the plate from the backside,
topedge corrsesponds to same placement as backcorner, but coming down onto the
plate (downward vs. lateral), and front corresponds to the front of the plate
which would expect to be largest flexural excitation.
