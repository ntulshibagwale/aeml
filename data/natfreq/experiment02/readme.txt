This data was generated June 7, 2022.

The aluminum plate was clamped so that the area between the two grips
were approximately 2, 4, 6, and 8 inches. The sensor WAS NOT touched
in between reconfiguration of the fixed points.

The fixed points on the plate were adjusted by using machinists grips
and aluminum fixtures. The plate fixtures were adjusted one at a time
such that the plate did not move. Hence the pencil lead broke at the 
exact same spot everytime. The angle of hte pencil was held at 40deg.

Did about 7-8 clicks, so that the pencil lead would break in about the 
exact same spot everytime right at the edge of the plate, but in the center,
directly across from the sensor center (approximately).

I was curious how modifying the placement of the fixed points would change
the plate natural frequency (like frets on a guitar). I do think
I may need to run this test again but breaking the pencil lead on the side
of the plate to excite more of the extensional modes, also because as the 
plate grips move further and further, the plate can deflect more, which
likely changes the initial impulse to the system.

Weird, about 10 mn into 8 in experiment the sensor starting capturing ALOT
of events. Not sure if this is due to defleciton, but something to try
and thinkin bout why it is occuring. Maybe its duration the sensor is on?
I hope not.
