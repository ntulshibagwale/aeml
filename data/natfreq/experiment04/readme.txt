So this is still going to be side experiments, but
I'm orienting the pencil so it always breaks at the same
point. on the top edge at an angle.
As long as the angle and the lead location remains the same
signal should remain constant.

Going to do the same 2,4,6,8 in investigation now,
where I do about 100 signals...
